Replicated the design given (design-reference.png) from scratch.

There are some things I wish I did differently such as not using anchors in the header and sidebar. I did this because I wanted the cursor to change to a pointer style but it would have been better to just set the cursor style in them to pointer like I did for later elements. Other than that I'm pretty happy with this.

Pretty happy with this except for I wish you didn't need to scroll to see the whole website, I might come back to this later to fix that but it's time to move onto the next lesson in the odin project.

Looking at the design reference I am missing some box shadows, might come back later and add them. (I did add the shadow from the header though so I know how to do it)
